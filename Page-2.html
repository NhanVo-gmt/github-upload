		<h2>Responsive Data Table Roundup</h2>
		<p>The idea of the original was to abandon the grid layout of the table and
		make each cell its own line. Each of those lines is labeled with a pseudo
		element. This creates a much taller table, requiring more vertical
		scrolling, but does not require horizontal scrolling. It’s easier to browse
		the data without losing the context of what’s what. The downside is that you
		might lose the context of data comparison since you no longer see cells of
		data right next to other cells of that type.</p>

		<h3>Change the table style</h3>
		<p>In this demo, it’s pie chart that is much narrower than the complete data
		table and thus more suitable for small screens.</p>

		<h3>Hide unecessary information</h3>
		<p>There is a problem that large data tables can stretch out the width of a parent
		container beyond what a small screen is capable of displaying. So to prevent
		this, a media query is used to hide the table on small screens, replaced
		with a small mock-table and a link to view the full table.</p>

		<p> Using small screens to focus information to the most important things is
		great, it just shouldn’t lock away information with no recourse. Maggie
		Costello Wachs of Filament Group also had the idea of hiding non-essential
		columns on smaller screens, but also providing a dropdown menu where you can
		re-enable them if you wish (which you can get to see with horizontal 
		scrolling).</p>
