		<h3>Quick summary</h3>
		<p><strong>Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their
		website.</strong> It’s practically essential after all: one design for the BlackBerry,
		another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen
		resolutions must be compatible, too. In the next five years, we’ll likely
		need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness
		stop? It won’t, of course.</p>

		<p>In the field of Web design and development, we’re quickly getting to the
		point of being unable to keep up with the endless new resolutions and
		devices. For many websites, creating a website version for each resolution
		and new device would be impossible, or at least impractical. Should we just
		suffer the consequences of losing visitors from one device, for the benefit
		of gaining visitors from another? Or is there another option?</p>

		<h3>What is Responsive Web Design</h3>
		<p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and
		development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on
		screen size, platform and orientation.</p>
		<p>The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and
		an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their
		laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for
		resolution, image size and scripting abilities. One may also have to
		consider the settings on their devices; if they have a VPN for iOS on their
		iPad, for example, the website should not block the user’s access to the
		page. In other words, the website should have the technology to
		automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the
		need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the
		market.</p>
		<p>Responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and
		automatically resizable images, but rather about a whole new way of thinking
		about design. Let’s talk about all of these features, plus additional ideas
		in the making.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="body-ele">
		<h3>Adjusting Screen Resolution</h3>
		<p>we can make things more flexible. Images can be automatically adjusted,
		and we have workarounds so that layouts never break (although they may
		become squished and illegible in the process). While it’s not a complete
		fix, the solution gives us far more options. It’s perfect for devices that
		switch from portrait orientation to landscape in an instant or for when
		users switch from a large computer screen to an iPad.</p>

		<h3>Stop Iphone Simulator Image Resizing</h3>
		<p>One nice thing about the iPhone and iPod Touch is that Web designs
		automatically rescale to fit the tiny screen. A full-sized design, unless
		specified otherwise, would just shrink proportionally for the tiny browser,
		with no need for scrolling or a mobile version. Then, the user could easily
		zoom in and out as necessary.</p>
		<p>There was, however, one issue this simulator created. When responsive Web
		design took off, many noticed that images were still changing proportionally
		with the page even if they were specifically made for (or could otherwise
		fit) the tiny screen. This in turn scaled down text and other elements.</p>

		<h3>Showing Or Hiding Content</h3>
		<p>It is possible to shrink things proportionally and rearrange elements as
		necessary to make everything fit (reasonably well) as a screen gets smaller.
		It’s great that that’s possible, but making every piece of content from a
		large screen available on a smaller screen or mobile device isn’t always the
		best answer. We have best practices for mobile environments: simpler
		navigation, more focused content, lists or rows instead of multiple
		columns.</p>

		<p>Responsive Web design shouldn’t be just about how to create a flexible

		been allowing us to show and hide content with ease for years!</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Responsive Web design and the techniques discussed above are not the
		final answer to the ever-changing mobile world. Responsive Web design is a
		mere concept that when implemented correctly can improve the user
		experience, but not completely solve it for every user, device and platform.
		We will need to constantly work with new devices, resolutions and
		technologies to continually improve the user experience as technology
		evolves in the coming years.</p>
